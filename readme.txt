Hello, this little program, can a create, deleting, buying, registration and little more.
Program a disastrous code, but again writing is very bad.
Tested at MinGW 5.1.03 C++14, but if you don't have this compiler, all function can will replace with older counterpart.
For example :  random device can change with srand(time(NULL)), std::to string -> std::stoi, or atoi
Sorry, for my English ;]
