Hello, this little program, can a create, deleting, buying, registration and little more.
Program a disastrous code, but again writing is very bad.
Tested at MinGW 5.1.03 C++14, but if you don't have this compiler, all function can will replace with older counterpart.
For example :  random device can change with srand(time(NULL)), std::to string you can change with string stream buffot, with: 
istringstream. How do it ? http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/istringstream/istringstream/ 

I'm trying spend new version, but I do not know is it introduces more bug, or more correct.
Sorry, for my English ;]
Regards ;]
